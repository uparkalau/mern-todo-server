# To-Do MERN Server

This is a single-page web application (SPA) designed to create and manage to-do lists. The app uses a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The application does not require any login or authentication, and all data is stored on the server-side.

## Installation

### Server Side

1. Clone the server-side repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/uparkalau/mern-todo-list.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the server directory: Open a terminal and navigate to the server directory of the cloned repository:

   ```
   cd mern-todo-list/back
   ```

3. Install dependencies: Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the server: Run the following command to start the server:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   The server should now be running on `http://localhost:8000`.
